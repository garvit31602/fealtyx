### Installation

To get started, ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/garvit31602/fealtyx.git
cd fealtyx
pip install -r requirements.txt
If waitress is missing, install it separately with:

bash
Copy code
pip install waitress
Configuration
Create a vercel.json file in the root directory. This file configures Vercel for deployment and specifies the main Python file.

json
Copy code
{
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
      {
        "src": "app.py",
        "use": "@vercel/python"
      }
    ],
    "routes": [
      {
        "src": "/(.*)",
        "dest": "/app.py"
      }
    ]
}
Note: Replace "app.py" with the filename of your Flask app if different.

Running Locally
To run the application locally:

Run the server with waitress:

bash
Copy code
waitress-serve --port=8000 app:app
Replace app:app with the filename and instance of your Flask application if different.

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to view the app.

Deploying to Vercel
To deploy the app to Vercel:

Install Vercel CLI (if not installed):

bash
Copy code
npm install -g vercel
Initialize the project on Vercel:

bash
Copy code
